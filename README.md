# deep-learning-challenge
The purpose of this analysis is to help Alphabet Soup, a nonprofit foundation, make informed decisions about which applicants to fund. By analyzing historical data on more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup, we aim to create a binary classifier. This classifier will predict the likelihood of an applicant's success if funded.

Key Objectives:
Maximize Funding Impact: By predicting which applicants are most likely to be successful, Alphabet Soup can allocate its resources more effectively, ensuring the funds have the maximum positive impact.

Data-Driven Decision Making: Leveraging machine learning allows for objective and data-driven decisions, reducing biases and improving the overall efficiency of the funding process.

Improve Success Rates: By identifying the characteristics of successful applicants, the classifier can help improve the overall success rates of funded ventures, leading to better outcomes for both the recipients and Alphabet Soup.

Process Overview:
Data Collection: Using a dataset that includes various features such as application type, affiliation, classification, use case, organization type, status, income amount, special considerations, funding amount requested, and whether the funding was used effectively.

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming the data to make it suitable for analysis and model training.

Model Training: Building and training a neural network model to classify applicants based on their likelihood of success.

Evaluation: Assessing the model's performance using appropriate metrics to ensure its reliability and accuracy.

Deployment: Implementing the model for real-time predictions, aiding Alphabet Soup in making future funding decisions.

By conducting this analysis, Alphabet Soup aims to enhance its decision-making process, ensuring that funds are directed to projects with the highest potential for success, ultimately leading to greater impact and fulfillment of the foundation's mission.
The nonprofit foundation Alphabet Soup wants a tool that can help it select the applicants for funding with the best chance of success in their ventures.

### Overview of the Analysis

**Purpose**: The purpose of this analysis is to develop a binary classifier that can predict the success of applicants funded by the non-profit foundation Alphabet Soup. This helps the foundation to allocate its resources more effectively by identifying applicants with the best chance of success.

### Results

#### Data Preprocessing

- **Target Variable(s)**: 
  - `IS_SUCCESSFUL`: Indicates whether the funding was used effectively.

- **Feature Variable(s)**: 
  - `APPLICATION_TYPE`: Alphabet Soup application type
  - `AFFILIATION`: Affiliated sector of industry
  - `CLASSIFICATION`: Government organization classification
  - `USE_CASE`: Use case for funding
  - `ORGANIZATION`: Organization type
  - `STATUS`: Active status
  - `INCOME_AMT`: Income classification
  - `SPECIAL_CONSIDERATIONS`: Special considerations for application
  - `ASK_AMT`: Funding amount requested

- **Variables to Remove**: 
  - `EIN`: Identification number
  - `NAME`: Organization name
  - These variables are not useful for the predictive model and are removed to avoid potential overfitting.

#### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model

- **Neural Network Architecture**:
  - **Neurons and Layers**: 
    - Input Layer: Number of neurons equal to the number of input features (9).
    - Hidden Layers: Two hidden layers with 8 and 5 neurons respectively.
    - Output Layer: Single neuron for binary classification.

  - **Activation Functions**: 
    - Hidden Layers: ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)
    - Output Layer: Sigmoid (for binary classification)

  - **Reasons for Selection**: 
    - ReLU helps in handling the vanishing gradient problem and speeds up convergence.
    - Sigmoid is suitable for binary classification tasks.

- **Model Performance**:
  - Target model performance was partially achieved with an initial accuracy of approximately 72%.
  - **Steps to Increase Performance**:
    - Hyperparameter tuning (batch size, learning rate)
    - Addition of dropout layers to prevent overfitting
    - Data augmentation techniques to enhance the training set

- **Keras-Tuner provided the best oarameters for training the model**:
{'activation': 'relu',
 'first_units': 9,
 'num_layers': 5,
 'units_0': 9,
 'units_1': 5,
 'units_2': 7,
 'units_3': 9,
 'units_4': 9,
 'units_5': 7,
 'tuner/epochs': 20,
 'tuner/initial_epoch': 7,
 'tuner/bracket': 2,
 'tuner/round': 2,
 'tuner/trial_id': '0045'}

#### Summary

- **Overall Results**: The deep learning model achieved satisfactory performance but showed room for improvement.
- **Recommendations**:
  - **Alternative Models**: Consider using ensemble methods such as Random Forests for potentially better performance. These models can handle a large number of features and are less prone to overfitting.
  - **Reasoning**: Ensemble methods combine the predictions of multiple models, which can lead to more robust and accurate predictions compared to a single neural network model.
